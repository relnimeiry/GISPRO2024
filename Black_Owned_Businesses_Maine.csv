Along with 11 other Somalis. Maine was considered a mecca because it exemplified the idealistic American life sought after by the Somali community. Fatuma took a chance on this dream and arrived in Portland, ME on February 4th, 2001 in search of a better place to live. On a snowy day, she was greeted with an even warmer welcome and a new reality in Portland. Fatuma and her fellow travellers were given a grand tour of their Maine along with Somali food, like Halwa. Maine’s small, burgeoning Somali community seemed to have found a simple, safe life where there were new possibilities not yet seen in Atlanta. Unfortunately, these new Mainers informed the travellers about new families struggling in Portland because the city lacked the resources for large number of migrants. Instead, Lewiston began popping up because it seemed safe and open to new people. Fatuma, as well as dozens of Somali families, took this advice and migrated north to Lewiston. While Portland struggled with homeless Somalis for some time, Lewiston had to begin bracing itself for the hundreds of Somalis coming.","Discover the challenges, warmth, and eventual migration to Lewiston, where the Somali community found safety and new possibilities in the face of limited resources.","Cultural Organizations, Nonprofits",English,"1220 Lisbon Street Suite 2 Lewiston, Maine","Lewiston, Maine",info@uswofmaine.org,2077530061,https://www.facebook.com/ircofmaine,https://www.instagram.com/immigrantresourcecenterofmaine,Black Owned Maine

The organization was formed by a group of New Mainers in response to a long overdue social injustice in our education system, workforce, housing, criminal justice, mental health, and unequal access to opportunities and disparities based on race and ethnicity, family structure, and socioeconomic status. Our youth have been facing various challenges over the years including poor academic performance, school dropouts, unemployment, legal troubles, mental health, soccer field shortages, poverty, social inequalities, engaging in gang-related activities, and family dysfunction. LA Youth Network is committed to break down barriers to purposely create a safe space for our immigrant and refugee youth to feel safe, feel respected, feel heard, get involved, engaged, and empowered. Our long-term strategy is to empower more youth to take leadership roles, create authentic youth-led impacts, take part of the decision table by engaging more in community activities in a manner that is productive and constructive. We want our youth to be part of a broader social justice movement, build a coalition to mobilize young people to create broad, significant changes in our community and increase awareness of racial and ethnic disparities in schools, healthcare, criminal justice, and employment, and housing. As the driving force of our immigrant and refugee youth population, we intend to create our own impact by using our own experiences and voices in creating broad, significant changes in our community. We want to mentor others, lift each other, empower each other, and ensure that we have a seat at the decision table by engaging in our community activities in a manner that is productive and constructive; recognize, utilize, and enhance young people’s strengths. We intend to eliminate and put an end to the rise of street gun violence, rise of drug and alcohol use, homelessness, poor academic performance, teen pregnancy, poverty, declining labor force participation, sports field shortages, rise of social inequalities, and promote healthy family-youth relationships.","Lewiston Auburn Youth Network is a brand-new, ethnic-based, nonprofit organization, with its principal office in the heart of Lewiston-Auburn, serving disadvantaged immigrant and refugee youth who came from low-income background families, between 8 – 16 years…",Nonprofits,English,"210 Blake street Lewiston , Maine","Lewiston , Maine",info@lewayn.org,2078887070,,,Black Owned Maine

They are alone in a strange land. They don’t know the language or the culture. They may not even know how to read or write in their own language, much less in English. Perhaps they have fled everything familiar to them because home isn’t safe anymore. Perhaps they have experienced incredible trauma in their home country or in a refugee camp. Perhaps they’ve had to leave behind a spouse or parents or children — or maybe they have lost them to war. Everything is confusing and overwhelming for them. Coming to a new country has it challenges, challenges that are hard to overcome for people who don’t speak the language or understand the culture. The way of life here in the United States is different than it is in other countries and in refugee camps. Immigrants and refugees need a support system — a place where they can go to get help, a place where their language and culture are understood and respected, a place where they see familiar faces, and, most importantly, a place where children and parents can gain the education that will help them become successful and contributing members of their new communities. That’s where Maine Immigrant and Refugee Services steps in.","Basically we offers a supportive haven, understanding language and culture, providing crucial help, and fostering education for successful integration.","Cultural Organizations, Nonprofits","French, English, Somali","256 Bartlett Street Lewiston, Maine","Lewiston, Maine",rilwan@meirs.org,2077820260,https://www.facebook.com/sbyam2008,,Black Owned Maine

Currently, I am studying film at Emerson College, but cooking is also one of my passions. When I was fifteen, I began cooking. I wanted to be like my mom who was always in the kitchen cooking delicious meals. It was only a matter of time before I discovered the beauty and joy of cooking for the people around me. The mission of my business is to provide people with fine dining experiences with the goal of owning restaurants all over the world.","ZFD is a dining service catered to everyone.
